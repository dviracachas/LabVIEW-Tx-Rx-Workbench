# LabVIEW Tx & Rx Workbench
This repository cointains a set of LabVIEW files used to experiment with NOMA (SC-SIC) and RSMA communication schemes. These include demos featured in the work "A Practical Study of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Single vs. Multiple Common Messages" presented at SPAWC 2024 and available in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694543).
